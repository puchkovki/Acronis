# **Industrial programming course for MIPT (3-rd grade**

## [**Find number**](find-number/)

You have the integer sequence from 0 to `M` (not inclusive): [0;M). We'll call it `sequence`.

**Input** — unordered array of integer numbers of size `M-n`.
**Output** — array of missing numbers in the `sequence`.
> Example:
```
M = 5, arraySize = 3, array = {4, 1, 3}
Output = {0, 2}
```

## [**FizzBuzz**](fizz-buzz/)
**Input** - sequence of numbers.

Task:
 - If number is divizible by 3, replace it with fizz.
 - If number is divizible by 5, replace it with buzz.
 - If both, then fizzbuzz.
 - Output to the console.

**Division operation and modulo operation are prohibited.**

## [**Find bugs**](find-bugs/)

Find and correct as many bugs as you can in [orig.cpp](find-bugs/orig.cpp). Version without bugs is [solution.cpp](find-bugs/solution.cpp).

## [**Flyweight**](Flyweight.pptx)

Presentaion about the OOP pattern Flyweight.

## [**Obfuscation**](obfuscation.cpp)

The task was to make code most illegible. The source file contains the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

## [**Labs**](labs/)

Laboratory works made in the second part of the Industrial programming course.
